Feature: Make Friends
	As a diver
	So that I can share dive data (logs, photos)
	I want to connect with friends on Dive Portal

//This will allow the diver to search for a new friend
Scenario: Searching for Friends
	When I go to the "make friends" page
	And I search for a friend
	Then I should see all members with that name

//This will allow the diver to view an friend's profile
Scenario: Adding Friends
	When I go to the "make friends" page
	And I click on a person's name
	Then I should see their profile
